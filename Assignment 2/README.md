## Question 1 - Data Visualisation
1. Use appropriate data visualisation techniques and comment on the association of the price of King County houses with other characteristics of the house

## Question 2- Principal Component Analysis
1. Calculate the mean and the variance for each appropriate variable and discuss if scaling is necessary and justify your findings.
2. Perform a principal component analysis and give the principal components values/loadings
3. Explain the proportion of variance explained by each principal component using a graph.
4. Write the first two principal components in terms of the original variables in the given dataset
5. Construct the Biplot and interpret it


## Question 3 - Clustering
1. Cluster the 340 houses in King Coutny in the given dataset into 2 groups using K-means clustering
2. Visually display the clusters using the first two principal components (PCs)
3. Cluster the 340 houses in King County in the given dataset into 2 groups using hierarchical clustering. Consider Euclidena distance as the dissimilarity measure and the closest distance between two clusters as the maximum distance between them
4. Cluster the 340 houses in King County in the given dataset into 2 groups using hierarchical clustering. Consider Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure and the closes distance between two clusters are the average distance between them
5. Cluster the 340 houses in King County in the given dataset into 2 groups using hierarhical clustering. Consider Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure and the closest distance
between two clusters as the minimum distance between them
6. Visually display the clusters obtained in part c, d and e using the first two principal components (PCs).
7. Compare the results in part b, f and comment on your findings.


## Question 4 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

1. Divide the dataset into two sets namely training set and test set by assigning 75% of the observations to training set and the rest of the observations to the test set
2. Fit a support vector classifier, in order to classify whether a house has high or low price. [Hint: Clearly report the cross-validation errors associated with different values of this parameter].
3. Fit a support vector machine with polynomial basis kernels, in order to classify whether a house has high or low price. [Hint: Clearly report the cross-validation errors associated with different values of this parameter.].
4. Fit a support vector machine with radial basis kernels, in order to classify whether a house has high or low price, [Hint: clearly report the cross-validation errors associated with different values of this parameter.].
5. Comment on the predicition accuracy of the model in part b, c, and d. Hence suggests the best model with clear justification
